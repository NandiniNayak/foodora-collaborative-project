## Project Rules :

- Each member of the team picks up a task from the task list
- Before starting work, discuss with the team and plan out how would you handle independent tasks and dependent tasks
- Design and draw an ERD as a team before starting work too.
- Each person in the team has three major tasks.
i) implements the functionality and push to side branch, send a review request to a team mate and a request for independent testing.
ii) Review and test a team members code.
iii) Once reviewed and tested will merge the changes to master.
